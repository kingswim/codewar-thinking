Even Fibonacci numbers
Problem 2

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.



In [52]: reduce(lambda x,y:x+y,[fib(i) for i in range(1,100) if fib(i) <=4000000
    ...:   and fib(i)%2==1 ])
Out[52]: 4613732
