A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, a < b < c, for which,
a2 + b2 = c2

For example, 3^2 + 4^2 = 9 + 16 = 25 = 5^2.

There exists exactly one Pythagorean triplet for which a + b + c = 1000.
Find the product abc.

In [467]: [(i,y,(1000-i-y)) for i in range(1,1000) for y in range(i,1000-i) if (i*i+y*y)==(1000-i-y)*(1000-i-y)]
Out[467]: [(200, 375, 425)]

In [468]: 200*375*425
Out[468]: 31875000
